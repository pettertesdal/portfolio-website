# My Experience at TechnipFMC

Working at TechnipFMC was a great learning experience and my first real opportunity to engage in professional development work.

I had the chance to be involved from the ground up, contributing to the development of a large and complex project that, despite its challenges, we successfully completed.

The project was a **Digital Project Management Tool** for overseeing the overhaul of valve trees (XT GATES). Initially, I worked on this as part of my **Bachelor's thesis** with a team of three students from **Western Norway University of Applied Sciences**. After completing my degree, I continued working part-time at TechnipFMC to further develop and refine the system in collaboration with the company's users.

The application was built using **Nuxt.js** for the frontend and a **Node.js** backend. We implemented **Pinia** for state management and used **MSSQL** for the database, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow for the XT Service Team. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my time at TechnipFMC. The experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also gave me invaluable insight into real-world software development, teamwork, and problem-solving. Seeing the XT GATES system being used daily as a core tool for managing projects was a rewarding outcome of our efforts.

I am grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying the knowledge and experience I gained in future projects.
