# Student Society of Bergen

In my free time, I have **volunteered** in multiple roles within **student organizations** here in Bergen. Through this, I have become more deeply involved in **politics**, learned how to work in a **large organization**, and discovered the joy of **economics**. I have **led debates** on topics ranging from **nuclear power** and **alcohol** to **AI** and **tax law**. I have been responsible for a **budget of over 2 million kroner** and served as the **leader of the control committee**, overseeing the organization’s **statutes** and ensuring that **management** follows them.

## Holding Debates

During my time in the **debate committee**, I have had the pleasure of **overseeing**, **planning**, and **leading debates**. This role has given me many opportunities to meet **high-profile people**, while also teaching me how to **adapt to different personalities** and **prepare accordingly**.

## Leader of Economy

After a year in the organization, I decided I wanted to take on more responsibility. I applied to become the **leader of economy**, a position that gave me a **seat in management** for a year. In this role, I was involved in **voting**, **preparing budgets**, **submitting applications for financial support**, **writing reports**, and **leading a team**. The experience has been both **invaluable** and **highly enjoyable**.

## Leader of the Control Committee

In my final year, I served as the **leader of the control committee**, where I was responsible for **overseeing management** and ensuring that the organization **followed its rules**. Through this, I learned how to **stand my ground** and handle being **unpopular**, while also managing significant **pushback**. Saying **“no”** because **procedures** must be followed can be surprisingly difficult—especially when you want to be **flexible**. But in the end, if we don’t follow the **rules** we set for ourselves, the **organization risks falling apart**.

## Merger of Organizations

This past year, I have also been involved in **planning the merger** of the two largest student organizations in Bergen: our organization and **Det Akademiske Kvarter**. Together, we aim to create something similar to what exists in **Trondheim**. The process has involved significant work—**organizing the merger**, **creating a unified budget**, and **merging the charts of accounts** into one. It has been both a **challenging** and **rewarding experience**.
