# Personal Website
My personal website, built with **Nuxt**, serves both as an extended CV and as a playground for experimentation.

I wanted this site to be more than just a static résumé — it’s also a space where I can test ideas, try out technologies, and have fun with design. Since I already had a lot of experience with Nuxt, I chose it as the foundation and also explored its built-in content management features.

## Design
For the design, I started with the idea of **flowing lines on paper** as a visual theme. This evolved into using JavaScript animations on SVG lines, though making the flow look natural turned out to be more difficult than expected. I also experimented with **Three.js**, which I had been curious about for a while. In the end, the site uses a combination of both approaches, giving it a playful and dynamic feel.

## Content Management
Content is organized around three main areas: **work experience**, **projects**, and a **blog** (mostly for fun 🙂). Everything is dynamic — adding a new entry is as simple as dropping a Markdown file into `/work`, `/projects`, or `/blog`. The site then automatically displays the content while keeping it within the overall theme. Balancing flexibility with consistent design was a fun challenge, but I’m happy with how it turned out.

## Skills
I also wanted a more creative way to present my **skills**, rather than just listing them. Sticking with the “flowing lines” theme, I built animated links that loop continuously across the screen, changing color based on my level of experience with each skill.  

In hindsight, having the skill details expand downwards might not have been the best design choice (turns out I’m not great at layout decisions 😅). But for now, it works, and I’ll revisit the design when I have more time.
