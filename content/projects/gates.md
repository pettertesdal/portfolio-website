# Gates  
A project management platform developed through my bachelor’s degree.  
<!--more-->  

Gates was a project management platform tailored to the way **TechnipFMC** worked internally on their projects.  

I first got involved during my bachelor’s project, when TechnipFMC reached out with a set of challenges. My group and I accepted the task and spent the next weeks learning the ins and outs of their workflow and designing a solution. You can read more about this here: [hvlopen](https://hvlopen.brage.unit.no/hvlopen-xmlui/handle/11250/3144010).  

The solution was a project management platform built in **Nuxt** (a full-stack framework), connected to their in-house MSSQL database. After completing the bachelor’s, TechnipFMC invited us back to continue development. Over the next year, we refined the website, added missing features, and built additional versions for different in-house teams, all tied together through a central summary site.
