# Gates
A project management platform developed through my bachelors.
<!--more-->
Gates was a project management platform specifically made for the way TechnipFMC worked internally on their projects.
I first got started on the project through my bachelors, where TechnipFMC got in touch about their set of problems. We accepted the task and spent the next few weeks figuring out the ins and outs of their problem and finding a solution. You can read more about this here: [hvlopen](https://hvlopen.brage.unit.no/hvlopen-xmlui/handle/11250/3144010).

The solution we came up with was a project management platform made in Nuxt a fullstack framework. We built the website and connected it to their inhouse MSSQL database. This was a really fun project, and after finishing the bachelours, they asked if we could come back and continue the work. Through out the next year we ironed out the website, made extra features we didn't get time to finish. We added more versions of the website for different inhouse teams that all could be tracked through a summary website.
