# Doomsday
Doomsday is an algorithm to calculate what weekday a given date is.
<!--more-->
This is an algorithm that is made for calculating the weekday of any date. I wanted to be able to easily train this skill, therefore a simple game to help exercise this head calculation was made.

It is made with in javascript using the Phazer engine, and it includes a postgres database for tracking the leaderboard.

I've also added a fully functioning tutorial teaching you how to do the calculation.
