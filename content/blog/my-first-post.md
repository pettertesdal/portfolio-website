# The First Post of This New System is finally live!

After a lot of trial and error, debugging weird errors, and tweaking configurations, I’ve finally set up a working blog system on my PC. Now, I can easily write, publish, and manage articles without relying on external platforms.

## The Journey Here  
Setting this up wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. But after pushing through, I finally have a system that works!

## How It Works  
With this system I will be able to quickly make a markdown file in a folder, this automatically gets uploaded on the site and sorted by date.

So let this mark the first post, and hopefully, I will make time to post more!
