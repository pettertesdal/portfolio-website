# ðŸŽ‰The First Post of This New System is finally live!

After a lot of trial and error, debugging weird errors, and tweaking configurations, Iâ€™ve finally set up a working blog system on my PC. Now, I can easily write, publish, and manage articles without relying on external platforms.

## The Journey Here  
Setting this up wasnâ€™t exactly smooth sailing. There were plenty of issues to fix, including:  
- **Data Fetching Problems**: My blog index worked fine, but the individual post pages had trouble loading content.  
- **Strange Errors**: The infamous `"Cannot stringify a function"` error showed up and took some time to debug.  
- **Styling & Layout Adjustments**: A simple list of posts wasnâ€™t enoughâ€”I wanted something clean and readable.  

But after pushing through, I finally have a system that works!

## How It Works  
Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of how this blog is structured:  
1. **Blog Index Page**: Shows all blog posts in a single-column layout, displaying the title, date, and reading time.  
2. **Individual Blog Pages**: Clicking on a post takes you to a dedicated page with the full article.  
3. **Content Management**: Posts are stored in a collection and dynamically loaded.  

The best part? Everything runs locally on my PC, giving me full control over my content.

## Whatâ€™s Next?  
Now that the system is live, I can start writing about:  
- **Tech experiments & projects** Iâ€™m working on  
- **NixOS configurations** and setups I find useful  
- **Game development progress** (especially my roguelike project!)  
- **Random discoveries & thoughts** I want to document  

I might even add **comments, reactions, or tags** to make the blog more interactive.

## Final Thoughts
