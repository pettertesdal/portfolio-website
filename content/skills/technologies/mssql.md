# Microsoft Server sql
This is the DB structure used while making my bachelor project. Setting it up is a tad bit frustrating, mostly cause I don't like their ecosystem, but through need I've managed. However I would have liked some additional instruction in how to use it, as documentation only is a bit sparse and having someone experienced would be quite valuable.
